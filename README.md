# 🐾 Dog Breeds by Country – SQL & Power BI Project

## 📘 Overview

This beginner-friendly project explores the relationship between **dog breeds and their countries of origin**, using tools and techniques relevant to **data analytics**.

The goal is to practice the full data workflow:

* Designing a relational database
* Writing SQL queries for data cleaning and exploration
* Exporting results to Excel
* Preparing the data for **Power BI** dashboards

As I’m just starting with SQL and Power BI, this project reflects both my progress and the areas I aim to improve. It’s a foundational step in my journey toward becoming a data analyst.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

* **MySQL Workbench** – database creation & querying
* **SQL** – data exploration & deduplication
* **Excel** – data export & formatting
* **Power BI** – data visualization (in progress)

## 📂 Project Steps

1. **Created a database** (`DogBreedsDB`) and table (`DogBreed`) in MySQL
2. **Manually inserted data**: dog breed names and country of origin
3. **Removed duplicate entries** using SQL subqueries
4. **Exported cleaned data** to Excel
5. **Formatted dataset** for Power BI (structured table with headers)
6. *(Optional/Upcoming)*: Built Power BI report showing:

   * Number of breeds per country
   * Country distribution map
   * Popular origin regions

---

## 📝 Key Skills Practiced

* Writing basic to intermediate SQL queries (`SELECT`, `DELETE`, `GROUP BY`, `MIN()`)
* Using subqueries to clean data
* Understanding primary keys and database constraints
* Preparing structured data for visualization tools
* Applying attention to detail in early-stage data work

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Add more attributes (e.g. breed size, temperament)
* Normalize database (e.g. separate `Country` into its own table)
* Create full Power BI report with maps, charts, and slicers
* Publish report or dashboard online (e.g. Power BI Web or PDF)
